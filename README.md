# MisFormer
Rice is the staple food for approximately half of the world’s population. Seed viability has a crucial impact on the yield and seed quality. Existing seed viability testing methods heavily rely on manual inspections that are destructive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. To address the drawbacks of existing rice seed viability testing, we proposed a multispectral image-based non-destructive seed viability testing approach. Specifically, we collected multispectral data in 19 wavebands for five rice varieties first. Furthermore, we designed an end-to-end pipeline, denoted as MsiFormer by integrating a Yolo-based object detector and a vision transformer-based viability testing model, which effectively improved the automation and efficiency of existing techniques. In order to objectively evaluate the performance of the proposed method in this paper, we conduct a comparison between MisFormer and some other deep learning methods. The results showed that the accuracy of MisFormer achieved 94%.
